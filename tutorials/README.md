meegpipe tutorials
========

In this folder you will find some tutorials on how to use _meegpipe_. Most
of these tutorials are not toy examples but real use-cases of analysis and data
processing tasks performed at the [Sleep&Cognition][sc] team of the
[Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience][nin]. These training
materials are fairly advanced and you are strongly encouraged to first read
[meegpipe's documentation][meegpipe-api].

__IMPORTANT:__ These tutorials were designed for internal use within our
research group. Thus, the raw data files used in the tutorials are not always
publicly available.

* The [BATMAN tutorial][batman] illustrates the procedure for extracting useful
  features from Arterial Blood Pressure, Electroencephalography (ECG) and
  task-respose events.

* The [ssmd_rs tutorial][ssmd_rs] illustrates a typical pre-processing and
  data-cleaning workflow in a resting-state [hdEEG][hdeeg] study.
