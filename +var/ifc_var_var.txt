Interface: var
============

[[Parent]]: pkg_var.txt

The interface `var` is organized in two groups of methods: 


## First group

This first group of methods contains methods with a common (generic) 
implementation shared by all classes that inherit the `data` interface.
 Therefore, this first group of methods is implemented by the 
[var.abstract_var][a-var] class. It is strongly recommended for all classes
 that aim to implement the `var` interface to inherit from
 [var.abstract_var][a-var], instead of inheriting directly from the
 interface class `var.var`. 

[a-var]: [[Ref:class_var_abstract_var.txt]]

### [covMatrix, cM]   = acov(obj, lag)

`obj` is an object of a class that implements the interface. 

### pteVal = pte(obj, Gamma, Phi, Theta, lag)

`obj` is an object of a class that implements the interface. 

### pmiVal = pmi(obj, Gamma, Phi, Theta, lag)

`obj` is an object of a class that implements the interface. 

### diVal  = pteDirIndex(obj, Gamma, Phi, Theta, lag)

`obj` is an object of a class that implements the interface. 

### diVal  = pmiDirIndex(obj, Gamma, Phi, Theta, lag)

`obj` is an object of a class that implements the interface. 




## Second group


The second group of methods are likely to be class-specific and therefore
 are expected to be implemented by the final classes.


### dim = var_dimensionality(obj)

`obj` is an object of a class that implements the interface. 

`dim` is the dimensionality of the VAR model

### order = var_order(obj)

`obj` is an object of a class that implements the interface. 

`order` is the order of the VAR model


### c = var_coefficients(obj)

`obj` is an object of a class that implements the interface. 

`c` is a matrix with ''d'' rows (one for each data dimension) and ''dxK'' 
columns with ''K'' the model order.

### obj2 = var_disconnect(obj)

`obj` is an object of a class that implements the interface. 

`obj2` is an object identical to `obj`, but whose VAR coefficients have 
been appropriately modified so that each VAR dimensionality is completely 
independent from each other. In practice this means that the VAR coefficient
matrices and the innovations covariance matrix for `obj2` will be all 
diagonal matrices.
