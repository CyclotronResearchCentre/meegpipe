Class: estimator
============

[[Parent]]: ifc_var_var.txt

The `var.estimator` class is an abstract class that implements the 
the [var.var interface][var-ifc] by inheriting from class 
[var.abstract_var][var-]with two purposes:

* Define a common interface for all VAR estimation algorithms
* Implement shared functionality among VAR estimation algorithms

All classes implementing VAR estimation algorithms should inherit from 
class `var.estimator`. For an example of how to define such classes see
[help var.arfit][var-arfit].

## Interface

The `var.estimator` interface defines the following methods:

### obj  = learn(obj, data, varargin)

`obj` is an object that implements the interface, i.e. a child class of 
class `var.estimator`

`data` is a numeric matrix containing the observations to which the VAR 
model will be fit

Additional input arguments are possible as `'key', value` paris

### res  = residuals(obj, data);

`data` is a numeric matrix containing the VAR model observations

`res` is a numeric matrix containing the residuals of the VAR model

### data = observations(obj, res)

`res` is a numeric matrix containing the residuals (or _innovations_) of 
the VAR model

`data` is a numeric matrix containing the generated model observations


### crit = criteria(obj)

`crit` is a cell array with the names of the available model order selection
criteria
